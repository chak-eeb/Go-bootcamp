Shadowing in go:
shadowing occurs when you try to declare a variable that was already declared. for example:

var x int

if x, err := strconv.Atoi(x "10"); err == nil{
    fmt.Println("x is: ", x)
} else{
    fmt.Println(format "x is: ", x)
}

in this case the first print will be x = 10 but the second will be x = 0
x has been shadowed

to fix it we can declare both x and err outside the if statement and not use := sign
